For the past couple of years, I've been working with my sister on the tech startup [Cordical](https://www.cordical.com), which is centered around promoting fitness that is accessible to everyone.  We've been exploring mobile app solutions and have just released the first major update to our app [AccessiRep](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/accessirep/id1451239112)!

I encourage you to take a look at Cordical and/or AccessiRep if you're interested.  We'll be continuing to release updates as well as exploring new products, but I'm excited to be at this stage of finally sharing our work.  You can see more from my sister, Cara, [at her blog](http://blog.cpolsley.com).
