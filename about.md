title: About Seth Polsley
---

Welcome! I thought it’d be fun to make a small GitHub page with more info about me. I’m a Masters student at Texas A&M University, and my research interests could be defined very generally as “intelligent systems.” To me this means creating computer systems that can operate in different environments and learn to understand the information around them, much in the same way as we learn about our surroundings. At A&M, my focus has been on sketch-based interaction, particularly in the areas of health and education, but more recently, my interests have shifted towards natural language processing.

Feel free to check out my links at the top of the page for a sense of the type of projects I work on or the things I write about.
